# Wallet Analytics for NFT Traders, Collectors and Whitelisters: A Solana Sandstorm project

## Overview
A React Web App that uses ChakraUI and Helius' NFT API to display wallet analytics for NFT traders, collectors and whitelisters.

## Motivation
NFT project owners look for ways to whitelist users that would be valuable members of the community and would hold their NFTs. This project is a tool that allows project owners to whitelist users based on their wallet analytics.

Additionally, wallet analytics will help NFT traders (include alpha callers and followers) to identify traders with true insights from LARPers. This project may also eventually have SoFi applications through enabling trade journaling, social trading/trading vaults (think STFX), etc.

## Application

A working demo of the application can be found at https://nftanalytics.dev/
